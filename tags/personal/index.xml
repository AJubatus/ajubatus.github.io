      <description>After my 2 weeks working in Taiwan, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d spend some time in Hong Kong, since the flights there from Taiwan were incredibly cheap!

April 21 I set out from my hotel in Taipei to Taoyuan International Airport early, and had some time to work on my screenshot tool project while waiting to board.
The flight was mostly uneventful, except my left ear wouldn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;pop&amp;rdquo; and stayed like this for the rest of the day :(</description>

      <description>I got to spend 2 weeks in Taiwan for work, so I decided to document it here :)
April 6 Day 1 consisted of me flying 2,956 kilometres towards Istanbul, where I spent another 3 hours waiting for my connecting flight.
April 7 Day 2 consisted of a further 8,407 kilometres, taking another 11 hours.
When I arrived at the airport, I decided to get a Taxi to the hotel since I hadn&amp;rsquo;t set up a work profile for Uber yet.</description>
